I am a graduate student of the University of Science and Technology of China. My major is software engineering. The research direction I am interested in is computer vision though. This is my personal study blog, which records my learning experience. I have a dream that I can have an opportunity to study in the top ten colleges in the world. Therefore, this blog is written in English.
